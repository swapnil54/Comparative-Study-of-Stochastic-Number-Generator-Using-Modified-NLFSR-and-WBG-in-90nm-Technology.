# Comparative-Study-of-Stochastic-Number-Generator-Using-Modified-NLFSR-and-WBG-in-90nm-Technology.
we created Stochastic number generator using modified NLFSR and WBG. instead of WBG, you can also use comparator as PCC but compromising power, delay and more area (for layout). we plan to create a 16bit stochastic number generatort

we have used cadence virtuoso (gpdk90). have not done the layout fully, in sha allah will complete the layout whole for 16bit as we have planned.
i will include some files from and out of cadence which may also help you create one. 
good luck, have fun with vlsi
